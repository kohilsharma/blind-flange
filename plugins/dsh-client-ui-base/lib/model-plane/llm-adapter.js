/**
 * Bridges our own `ModelProvider` contract (model-provider.js) onto the
 * harness's `ctx.llm.registerAdapter(providers, adapter)` seam.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT import `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm` to get its `LlmAdapter`
 * base class. Two things were verified directly against the installed
 * harness (0.1.1-rc.2) on 28 August 2026, the day-one timebox for this seam:
 *
 * 1. `registerAdapter` never does an `instanceof` check — every method it
 *    calls (`providerInfo`, `providerRetryPolicy`, `prepareCall`, `stream`)
 *    is duck-typed, so a plain object implementing them registers exactly
 *    like a real `LlmAdapter` subclass would.
 * 2. This plugin is mounted through a `link:` row in the profile's
 *    `package.json`, i.e. loaded through a symlink. Node resolves bare
 *    specifiers from a symlinked module's REAL on-disk path, which is this
 *    repo — not the profile's `node_modules` the harness's own packages live
 *    in — so `import "@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm"` from here fails with
 *    `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` even though the harness process has that package
 *    loaded and working.
 *
 * Duck-typing sidesteps both: the contract stays ours (CONTEXT.md "Plugin
 * contract" — "the harness is an implementation of them"), and there is
 * nothing here for the symlink to break.
