/**
 * The report-findings tool (Story 5.1).
 *
 * `sample-report-findings.json` is not fabricated: it is the literal response
 * the real ingestion service (`services/ingestion/server.py`, Epic 4) returned
 * on 28 Aug 2026 for a genuine `POST /v1/ingest/pdf` against the actual fixture
 * at `services/ingestion/fixtures/sample-inspection-report.pdf` — 156 OCR
 * lines, each with its real bounding box, confidence and page. This mirrors
 * `model-plane/replay-provider.js`'s own "captured, not authored" design for
 * Phase 0 (CONTEXT.md "Replay"): the ingestion service is a separate Python
 * process Epic 6 has not yet wired into one startup command, so calling it
 * live from inside a tool would make every demo run depend on that process
 * already being up. Reading the capture is what "an ingested inspection
 * report" (this story's Given) means until that wiring lands — a data swap
 * away from a live `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8642/v1/ingest/pdf')`, not a
 * rewrite of this file.
 *
 * The tool call itself is real: a genuine file read and JSON parse dispatched
 * through the ordinary tool registry, logged like any other call. Only the
 * model's synthesis of these lines into key findings is replayed text
 * (ADR-0001) — the same split canary.js documents for the egress seal.
 *
 * Written structurally against the harness's `ToolDefinition` shape, like
 * `../egress/canary.js`, rather than through `defineTool` — this package
 * resolves nothing from the harness's own installed packages (see
 * `../model-plane/llm-adapter.js` for why).
