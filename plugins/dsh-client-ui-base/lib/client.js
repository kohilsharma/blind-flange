/**
 * Blind Flange base plugin, browser half.
 *
 * Written directly in the host loader's module format, so this package ships no
 * React and needs no bundler: `require` inside the factory resolves
 * `react/jsx-runtime` and every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-*` package from the
 * host at load time.
 *
 * Deliberately not an ES module, despite `"type": "module"` in the manifest.
 * The host serves this file as a raw bundle to the browser's module loader and
 * never `import`s it, so it is written as the loader's own format — a top-level
 * `window.__ModuleLoader__.load(...)` call with a CommonJS-shaped factory. Only
 * `exports["./client"]` points here, and only the host reads that.
 *
 * Story 1.1 mounted the seam and took no slot. Story 1.5 is the first
 * occupant: the Blind Flange mark in `conversation.hero.brand.mark` and
 * `sidebar.brand.mark`, the two places the DeepSeek whale used to render (see
 * `apply` below for why both, not just the one AC1 names). What Story 1.1 did
 * do is check that the host supplied the React seam every later panel depends
 * on, so a broken seam is reported here, by package name, instead of
 * surfacing as an obscure failure inside the routing chip or the egress
 * monitor — kept as-is below.
 *
 * Story 1.4 takes this package's first slot: `conversation.hero.agentPreset`.
 * The host's own agent-preset roster always includes its four shipped presets
 * (`standard`/`code`/`minimal`/`cordis`) alongside ours — `dsh-agent-presets`
 * hard-codes its shipped root into every deployment's resolved config, so a
 * profile patch cannot remove them (verified against a running `dsh web`,
 * 28 Aug 2026: `agentPreset.list` names all four no matter what this profile's
 * `cordis.patch.yml` configures). This component is an indicator rather than a
 * wrapper around the host's own hero chip: it reads the same roster over the
 * same host RPCs and shows only the presets Blind Flange authored
 * (`trust: 'user'`), so "Standard mode" and its shipped siblings never appear
 * here even though the host still lists them elsewhere (Settings > Agent
 * presets, unavoidably, for the same reason).
 *
 * It shipped as a dropdown and was corrected to a read-only indicator on
 * 28 Aug 2026: SIH26117 requires the system to pick automatically, so a control
 * asking the operator to classify the task contradicts the entry's own claim.
 *
 * Story 3.8 — "the model changes by itself when the task type changes" — lives
 * on the routing chip, not here. `conversation.hero.*` is the new-session
 * screen: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-agent-preset`'s own `AgentPresetSeat`
 * records that the hero seat "is only available before a conversation starts",
 * and the hero is replaced by the conversation view once a turn runs — so the
 * hero indicator is never on screen at the moment a mid-session reclassification
 * happens. This indicator therefore stays a new-session affordance showing the
 * deployment's authored task types; the surface that visibly moves when the
 * router reclassifies is the routing chip at `conversation.input.model`, which
 * re-reads the `bf-routing` view every turn (see `buildRoutingChip`).
 *
 * Story 3.2 takes one more seat: `conversation.session.header.utilities`, a
 * read-only pill naming the active model-plane provider. When `replay` is the
 * provider it says so in plain words and says the responses are authored, not
 * captured (ADR-0001 amendment, 28 Aug 2026). The provider name is read from
 * the host's `llm.providers` directory — the Blind Flange adapter registered
 * in the host half (`index.js`) surfaces there as `Blind Flange (<provider>)` —
 * so this indicator reports the configured provider rather than guessing it.
 *
 * Story 3.7 takes the last seat: `conversation.input.model`, a `single` slot,
 * so occupying it replaces the stock model picker outright
 * (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-model-selection` is disabled in the profile —
 * docs/profile-install.md, Story 3.7 section). This is the routing chip
 * (CONTEXT.md): it names the fleet member the router picked for the last turn
 * and expands to show the working — the classified task type, the score per
 * fleet member, and the members filtered out before scoring with the reason
 * each was. The decision is not recomputed here: the host half appends a
 * `router/routed` session event per turn (Story 3.6), and this reads it back
 * through a registered conversation view (`bf-routing`) folded from that
 * event, so the chip shows the decision the router actually recorded — never
 * an animation without an event behind it (NFR8).
 *
 * Story 2.2 adds the egress monitor: a compact chip sharing
 * `conversation.session.header.utilities` and a full panel in `shell.overlay`.
 * Both show one number — the count of `egress/denied` session events the
 * denial waterfall records (host half) — folded through a registered
 * `bf-egress` conversation view. The zero is counted, never a literal (FR15),
 * and it is the rebuild of the 27 August spike's hand-rolled monitor against
 * the shipped primitives and theme tokens (UX-DR7).
 *
 * Story 2.3 adds the canary: a button in `conversation.input.right` that posts
 * to the host's loopback `/bf-canary` channel. The host dispatches a real tool
 * whose body calls `fetch`, the egress denial waterfall refuses it before that
 * body runs, and the monitor above turns red off the recorded denial rather
 * than off anything the button says.
 *
 * Story 2.4 adds no seat either. The egress monitor's full panel becomes the
 * audit surface: it lists every recorded denial — the timestamp the harness
 * stamped on the event, the tool, and the refused target — in the order the log
 * wrote them. The lines come from the same `bf-egress` view the count comes
 * from, so reading the log on screen needs no terminal and a fresh denial lands
 * in the list through the subscription that was already there.
 *
 * Story 4.5 adds the provenance crop viewer, this package's first
 * `conversation.view` seat — a whole tab. It lists every OCR finding the
 * ingestion service returned for the sample inspection report and, when one is
 * clicked, shows the region of the real scanned page that finding's bounding
 * box covers. The crop is cut in the browser from the full page image the host
 * serves (`findings/provenance.js`), so there is no pre-rendered crop anywhere
 * in this package and a changed bounding box moves the pixels on screen.
 *
 * Story 3.8 adds no seat. Because the `bf-routing` view keeps the highest-seq
 * `router/routed` node and the chip subscribes through `useSyncExternalStore`,
 * a turn that classifies as a different task type moves the chip to the newly
 * selected fleet member — trigger and expanded working both — with no user
 * action. Story 3.8 is the regression cover for that cross-turn behaviour.

		 * `conversation.session.header.utilities` (list, session) and a full
		 * panel in `shell.overlay` (list, root). Both read one number — the
		 * count of `egress/denied` session events the denial waterfall appends
		 * (host half, `index.js`) — folded through a registered conversation
		 * view. The zero is `that fold's node count`, never a literal (FR15),
		 * and it moves only on a real recorded denial, never an animation
		 * (NFR8). Story 2.3's canary is what first makes it non-zero on stage.
		 *
		 * This replaces the 27 August spike's `@blind-flange/dsh-client-ui-egress`
		 * (hand-written greens, a hand-rolled pill — the counter-example the UI
		 * rules exist to prevent, UX-DR7). Nothing here sets a colour: `StateDot`
		 * carries the green/red state through `--dsw-*` tokens, `Pill` and
		 * `Button` are shipped primitives, and the panel's surface uses only
		 * `ui-theme` background/border/shadow tokens.
		 *
		 * Story 2.4 makes the full panel the audit surface as well as the
		 * instrument: the same fold that produces the count also carries every
		 * denial's timestamp, tool and refused target, and the panel lists them
		 * oldest first. The decision to extend this panel rather than declare a
		 * separate audit seat is recorded in the story's spec — an evaluator who
		 * asks "show me" is already looking at the monitor, and a second surface
		 * showing the same events would be two places to keep in step.

		/**
		 * Client plugin body. Checks the React seam, then takes nine seats.
		 *
		 * Story 1.5's mark goes into `conversation.hero.brand.mark` — `single`,
		 * so occupying it replaces whatever the host registered there (the
		 * DeepSeek whale) — and `sidebar.brand.mark`, the collapsed-rail seat:
		 * with `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-brand-official` disabled
		 * (`cordis.patch.yml`, `id: ui-brand-official`) nothing else fills it,
		 * and ui-layout falls back to its own built-in whale rather than
		 * rendering nothing, so we take it too rather than leave that fallback
		 * showing.
		 *
		 * `sidebar.brand.mark` is not in the verified seat table in
		 * `docs/deepseek-harness-notes.md` — nothing in this repo confirms which
		 * package declares it (its one known filler, `ui-brand-official`, is the
		 * one we've disabled). Confirmed empirically instead, by screenshot
		 * (`docs/screenshots/1-5-brand-mark-*.png`): re-verify by source if a
		 * harness upgrade ever changes ui-layout's rail rendering.
		 *
		 * Story 1.4's task-type indicator goes into `conversation.hero.agentPreset`,
		 * replacing the host's own chip for this deployment. It displays; it does not
		 * choose (corrected 28 Aug 2026 — see `buildTaskTypeIndicator`).
		 *
		 * Story 3.2's provider disclosure goes into
		 * `conversation.session.header.utilities` — a session-scoped `list` slot,
		 * so it is additive rather than a replacement — naming the active
		 * model-plane provider, and saying "replay" and "authored" in plain words
		 * when that is the provider (see `buildProviderDisclosure`).
		 *
		 * Story 3.7's routing chip goes into `conversation.input.model` — `single`,
		 * so occupying it replaces the stock model picker
		 * (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-model-selection`, disabled in the profile).
		 * It also registers a conversation view (`bf-routing`) and the event
		 * Definition that feeds it, both on `ctx.conversationEvents` /
		 * `ctx.conversationViews`, so the chip reads the router's recorded
		 * `router/routed` decision rather than recomputing it.
		 *
		 * Story 2.2's egress monitor takes two more: the compact chip shares
		 * `conversation.session.header.utilities` with the provider disclosure
		 * (list, additive), and the full panel takes `shell.overlay` (list,
		 * root). Both read one number — the count of `egress/denied` events —
		 * through a registered `bf-egress` conversation view; the chip toggles
		 * the panel through a module-scoped open store.
		 *
		 * Story 4.5's crop viewer takes `conversation.view` (list, session) — a
		 * whole tab beside Chat and Trajectory. It reads the ingestion capture
		 * and the real page images from the host's provenance route rather than
		 * from a session event: the findings are what a document ingested
		 * through Epic 4 produced, not something a turn recorded.
		 *
		 * Story 2.3's canary takes `conversation.input.right` (list, session):
		 * the button that fires a real outbound attempt through the host's
		 * loopback `/bf-canary` channel so the denial can be watched happening.
		 * It is registered behind a nested `ctx.inject(["connection"])` so that a
		 * client with no host transport loses the button and keeps everything
		 * else.
		 *
		 * A broken React seam aborts all nine: every one of them renders
		 * through the host's `react/jsx-runtime`, so registering into a slot
		 * without it would trade one loud console error for obscure render
		 * failures. (The conversation Definitions carry no React and are
		 * registered regardless — a chip that never renders still leaves the
		 * session log's routing and egress views correct for anything else
		 * that reads them.)
		 * @param ctx - client root context, carrying the `slots`,
		 * `conversationEvents`, `conversationViews` and `sessions` services
		 * declared in `inject` below.
