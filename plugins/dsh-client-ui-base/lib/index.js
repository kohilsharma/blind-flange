/**
 * Blind Flange base plugin, host half.
 *
 * Story 1.1 gave this package a host-side row with an empty apply. Story 1.5
 * hung our own tab title and favicon on it, replacing DeepSeek Harness's,
 * over the `webServer` service's own extension points (`register` for a new
 * route, `tapIndex` for a pure html-to-html transform) rather than by
 * editing the harness's built `dist/index.html` or `dist/favicon.svg`, which
 * NFR5 forbids touching. Story 2.1 adds the egress denial waterfall
 * alongside it, and Story 2.2 has that waterfall append an `egress/denied`
 * marker event the on-screen egress monitor counts. Story 2.3 hangs the canary
 * here: a real tool (`egress/canary.js`) whose body genuinely calls out, named
 * in the same deny-list so the same waterfall refuses it, plus the loopback RPC
 * channel the composer button fires it through.
 *
 * `conversation.hero.brand.mark` — the third piece of AC1 — is a client-side
 * slot and is registered in client.js instead; this file only reaches what a
 * server-rendered index.html can reach.
 *
 * Story 3.1 adds the model plane: `ctx.llm.registerAdapter` bridges our own
 * `ModelProvider` contract (`model-plane/model-provider.js`) onto the
 * harness's model seam, defaulting to `replay`. See `model-plane/llm-adapter.js`
 * for why that bridge is duck-typed rather than importing `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`.
 *
 * Story 3.5 adds the router's classifier: an `agent/pre-step` listener runs
 * `router/classify.js` over each fresh request and appends the structured task
 * type to the session log. Story 3.6 extends that same listener to score the
 * licence-checked fleet against the classified task type and append the routing
 * decision (`router/routed`) alongside it.
 *
 * Story 5.3 extends the same `tools/pre-execute` waterfall to the `pwsh` tool
 * (`tool-pwsh`, enabled by `cordis.patch.yml`): unlike the network-capable
 * tools above, `pwsh` must run for ordinary coding tasks, so it is not denied
 * by name — only a call whose command text itself reaches for the network is
 * refused, recorded on the same `egress/denied` event the monitor already
 * counts.
 *
 * Story 5.4 adds the approval-note tool (`deliverables/tool.js`): a real
 * `.docx` written to disk from a completed set of findings, registered
 * unconditionally like the canary and the report-findings tool.
 *
 * Story 3.9 registers our three plugin-owned session event types into the
 * harness's persistence read-path vocabulary at mount
 * (`session-events/known-types.js`), so a stored session containing them
 * still opens instead of failing with `SessionFormatUnsupportedError`.
 *
 * Story 4.5 adds the provenance route (`findings/provenance.js`) beside the
 * favicon route below: the crop viewer in the browser loads the ingestion
 * capture and the real page images from it, and crops in the browser. Like
 * the favicon it is served through `webServer.register`, so a profile with no
 * web server simply does not have it.
 *
 * Story 3.10 fixes the classifier reading the wrong turn's text (or none).
 * `agent/pre-step` hands the listener `messages: claimed` directly in its
 * payload — `Inbox.claim()` in the harness (`packages/core/agent/src/inbox.ts`)
 * defines that as exactly the batch proposed for *this* step, stamped with
 * this turn's number before the event even fires. Story 3.5/3.6 ignored that
 * and read `decision.messages` from the far end of the `next()` waterfall
 * instead — whatever every other `agent/pre-step` listener downstream chose
 * to hand back, which is not the same guarantee. Classification now reads the
 * payload's own `messages`, never `decision.messages`.
